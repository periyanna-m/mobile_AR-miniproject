🌿 Abstract
This project presents an Augmented Reality (AR) Plant Garden application developed using Unity and C#. By leveraging the principles of L-Systems for procedural generation, the application enables users to dynamically create, customize, and visualize virtual trees placed within their real-world environment. The HUD (Heads-Up Display) interface allows intuitive control over key parameters such as tree type, branch angle, iterations, length, width, and natural randomness (variance). Upon user command, trees are procedurally generated, scaled for enhanced visualization, and seamlessly integrated into the AR scene. The project utilizes AR Foundation to detect surfaces and anchor the generated trees accurately in physical space. This interactive experience promotes engagement, creativity, and a deeper appreciation of plant structures, showcasing the potential of combining procedural content generation with augmented reality technologies.

The AR Plant Garden lets users dynamically generate, customize, and place virtual trees into the real world using Augmented Reality. Built with Unity, C#, and AR Foundation, it combines procedural tree generation through L-Systems with intuitive user controls for an immersive and creative experience.

Key Highlights:
Real-time tree generation using L-Systems.

Dynamic user control through an easy-to-use HUD panel.

Augmented reality placement with surface detection.

Automatic tree scaling for better visual impact.

Supports customization and interaction within an immersive environment.
